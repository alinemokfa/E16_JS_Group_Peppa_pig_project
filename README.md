#### Peppa Pig App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts.
